The model training phase of the project focused on developing and fine-tuning several machine learning models to predict the 'Stars(out of 5)' rating for books. The initial step involved selecting the features and the target variable, followed by splitting the data into training and testing sets. This established a solid foundation for model training and subsequent evaluation.

The first model explored was Linear Regression. Using GridSearchCV, various parameters were tuned, including whether to fit the intercept. The optimal model parameters were identified, and the model was trained on the training data. The Mean Squared Error (MSE) on the test set was calculated to assess its performance. This approach ensured that the model was adjusted to best fit the training data, while also evaluating its ability to generalize to new data.

Next, a Decision Tree Regressor was implemented. GridSearchCV was utilized again to optimize the hyperparameters, specifically the maximum depth of the tree and the minimum number of samples required to be at a leaf node. The training process involved fitting the model with these optimal parameters to the training data. The model's performance was then evaluated by calculating the MSE on the test set, providing insights into its predictive accuracy and potential overfitting or underfitting issues.

The K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Regressor was another model explored during this phase. GridSearchCV was used to determine the best number of neighbors and the weight function used in prediction. The optimal KNN model was trained on the training dataset, and its performance was evaluated using the test set MSE. This model's ability to capture local patterns in the data was critically assessed through this process.

A Gradient Boosting Regressor was also trained and tuned using GridSearchCV. The hyperparameters tuned included the number of boosting stages, the learning rate, and the maximum depth of the individual estimators. The optimal combination of these parameters was found, and the model was trained accordingly. Evaluating the MSE on the test set provided a measure of the model's performance and its capability to handle complex data relationships through boosting.

The model training phase involved a thorough exploration and tuning of several machine learning algorithms, each evaluated for their predictive performance using the MSE metric.
